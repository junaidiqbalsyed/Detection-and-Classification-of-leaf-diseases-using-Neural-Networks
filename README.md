Main objective of my project is to detect the diseased leaf and classify into unhealthy or a healthy status from the acquired dataset. This work is carried out using convolutional Neural Networks using LeNet architecture for classification and feature extraction after preprocessing and segmentation process.
Main advantage of this project is able to detect the three common type of diseases such as Late Blight, Bacterial Spot and Yellow curl leaf. This was implemented using open source Python with tensorflow library by successfully achieving 98.6% accuracy.
